This project provides a Java implementation of the [DRMAA](http://www.drmaa.org/) specification. It provides a light wrapper around command line executables as `qsub` and `qstat`. Users can choose to run these commands in the same computer where the Java code is being executed, or run them via SSH. The SSH support is provided by the [XebiaLabs overthere library](https://github.com/xebialabs/overthere), which means that some of its features a propagated tot he library (e.g. SSH [jump stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) support).
